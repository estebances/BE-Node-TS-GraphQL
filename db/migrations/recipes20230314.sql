The mixture will be shaggy at this point. From here, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together (generally about 3 additional tablespoons).

Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Check on the galettes periodically. If at any time the crusts\' edges are getting too brown, take a piece of Reynolds WrapÂ® Aluminum Foil and tent over the edges. When the edges are golden brown, remove from the oven.
